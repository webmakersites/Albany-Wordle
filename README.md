# Albany Wordle - 

## About
Hey! This is a clone of wordle that has a new word each day (when updated), for Albany Area Schools in Albany Minnesota. It is designed so people can request words and have teachers play them. This has been forked from LanceWhitehorn's CustomWordle



## Code / Features
This is a quick summary and explanation of my code and features:
* Used Wordle's array of words but used a random number generator to pick a word allowing for a new game every time I loaded the page. *Feature has been Edited so I can change the word, in the clone*
* Used hodgef's [simple-keyboard](https://github.com/hodgef/simple-keyboard) for the on-screen keyboard which I manipulated using jQuery.
* Used [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev) to provide definitions for the chosen word.
* Made a light / dark theme using jQuery
